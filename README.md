This project leverages the Google Generative AI API to create a basic question-answer application. Users can input a query, and the script will provide a response generated by the Gemini model.

**Prerequisites:**

  - Python environment,
  
  * google-generativeai library installed (pip install google-generativeai)

**Usage:**
  - Replace the placeholder API key with your actual Gemini API key in the code.
  
  * Run the Python script.

[!NOTE]
Note: For production environments, consider using environment variables or secure configuration management for API keys.

Disclaimer: This is a basic example. Production-ready applications require additional features and security measures.
