Gemini Q&A App
This project leverages the Google Generative AI API to create a basic question-answer application. Users can input a query, and the script will provide a response generated by the Gemini model.

Prerequisites:

Python environment
google-generativeai library installed (pip install google-generativeai)
Usage:

Replace the placeholder API key with your actual Gemini API key in the code.
Run the Python script.
Note: For production environments, consider using environment variables or secure configuration management for API keys.

Disclaimer: This is a basic example. Production-ready applications require additional features and security measures.
